# Robotic Inference
Robotic Inference using NVIDIA Digits Workspace

This project includes the training model, training dataset and the report for the results obtained by training a robotic inference model on the NVIDIA digits workspace. The training model can be used directly on a NVIDIA TX2 Deep Learning Kit.

The model is used to classify food into guava, banana and junk food.
